--------Git Basics---------
Create a new local repository = git init
to check status = git status
Add to staging area  = git add "FileName.extension"
Add all file to staging area = git add *
revert all local uncommitted changes = git checkout .
unstage all files you might have staged with git add = git reset
Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository) = git commit -m "comment/message"
to push local repository to remote repository = git push - u origin master
Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then: git commit -a
